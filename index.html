    <h1>Welcome to our project page!</h1>
    <h2>What are we doing here?</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to run discord bots on every computer architecture there is.</p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>It came from another server where almost every user had their own bot, we also liked to play around with weird machines. It turned out to be a nice benchmark for a given systems usability; running discord bot requires ability to run arbitrary, unsigned code, having access to internet (working network stack) and being able to run python/nodejs or having proper c++ toolchain available. Therefore, if machine is able to run a discord bot, it's also able to run more usable stuff.</p>
    <h2>What success did you achieve already?</h2>
    <p>uhhh… uuuhhhhhh…</p>
    <p>The only requirement for the bot to be recognised here is pretty simple: it must respond to user command in any shape or form. Nice to have:</p>
    <uL>
        <li>Command for displaying `uname`, `neofetch` or anything else displaying basic system info in real time.</li>
        <li>Ability to run standardised benchmark (we settled on generating a specific GIF in the past, TBD)</li>
        <li>Photographs of the running system or even better, of the build/configuration process</li>
        <li>Actually useful functions</li>
    </uL>
